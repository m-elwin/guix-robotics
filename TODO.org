1. Add more packages.
2. Make rosdep work
   - Plan is to create a separate rosdep repo for this
3. There are several ROS paths and env variables that need to be setup
   it is unclear right now how best to integrate this flow with guix.
4. Documentation: ros has it's own documentation system, could
   export that as a :doc part of split packages for each ROS package
