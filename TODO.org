1. Check that catkin's inputs are specified directly by
   - Creating a guix shell environment with catkin and making sure that I can catkin_make_isolated catkin itself.
   - Check vcstool for a similar tool:
     - It uses python but is an executable (so not prefixed with python)
     - It calls other executables (which were inputs).

2. Transition ROS packages to the catkin-build-system
