0. ros-noetic-pluginlib tests are failing. Likely related to paths with rospack.
   - need to get these paths working better
1. Add more packages.
2. Make rosdep work
   - Plan is to create a separate rosdep repo for this
3. There are several ROS paths and env variables that need to be setup
   it is unclear right now how best to integrate this flow with guix.
4. Documentation: ros has it's own documentation system, could
   export that as a :doc part of split packages for each ROS package
5. Cleanup:
   Make a better package structure:
   ros-noetic/

   Then there will be 1 .scm file per repo that
   has many packages so the .scm files will
   map onto meta packages or packages that
   stand on their own.
