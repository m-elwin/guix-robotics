0. roswtf uses ROS_ROOT. Should define this
0. ros-noetic-pluginlib tests are failing. Likely related to paths with rospack.
   - need to get these paths working better
   - do a guix shell -D ros-noetic-pluginlib to get the dev environment

1. Add more packages.
3. There are several ROS paths and env variables that need to be setup
   it is unclear right now how best to integrate this flow with guix.
4. Documentation: ros has it's own documentation system, could
   export that as a :doc part of split packages for each ROS package
5. Cleanup:
   Make a better package structure:
   ros-noetic/

   Then there will be 1 .scm file per repo that
   has many packages so the .scm files will
   map onto meta packages or packages that
   stand on their own. It would help keep track of ros meta packages

   6. Can we change the prefix>?
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is only pat of it. might be a catkin_prefix of some kind
