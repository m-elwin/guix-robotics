0. Some packages are not working as expected. Likely due to mix ups with proper dependencies.

1. ros-noetic-pluginlib tests are failing. Likely related to paths with rospack.
   - need to get these paths working better
   - do a guix shell -D ros-noetic-pluginlib to get the dev environment

2. Documentation: ros has it's own documentation system, could
   export that as a :doc part of split packages for each ROS package

3. Cleanup:
   Make a better package structure:
   ros-noetic/

   Then there will be 1 .scm file per repo that
   has many packages so the .scm files will
   map onto meta packages or packages that
   stand on their own. It would help keep track of ros meta packages

4. Can we change the prefix?
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is only part of it. The problem is the prefix for python packages
      cannot be changed (easily) in guix as far as I know since it messes with GUIX_PATH
      - so far there are no naming conflicts so have not needed to put everything under a separate sub-directory
5. Add more packages.
